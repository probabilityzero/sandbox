      <h2>1. What are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device when you visit a

        We use cookies and similar technologies for the following purposes:
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.1 Essential Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies are necessary for the Service to function properly. They enable core 
        functionality such as security, authentication, and session management. You cannot opt 
        out of these cookies.

        These cookies allow us to remember choices you make when using the Service, such as your 
        preferred language, theme, or your last project. They enhance your experience by providing 
        personalized features.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.3 Analytics Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        We use these cookies to collect information about how you use our Service, which pages you 
        visit, and if you encounter any errors. This helps us improve our Service and measure the 
        effectiveness of our features.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.4 Functional Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies enable enhanced functionality and personalization, such as remembering your 
        code editor preferences or recently accessed projects.
      </p>
      
      <h2>3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Some cookies are placed by third-party services that appear on our pages. We use third-party 
        cookies for:

      <ul>
        <li>Analytics (to understand how you use our Service)</li>
        <li>Authentication (when you sign in using third-party services)</li>

      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Cookie Control</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, 
        limiting the ability of websites to set cookies may impact your user experience.
      </p>
      
      <h2>5. Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to cookies, we use local storage to save your code, projects, and preferences 
        locally on your device. This improves performance and allows for offline functionality.
      </p>
      
      <h2>6. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>

        We may update our Cookie Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
