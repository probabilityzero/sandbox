# Sandbox - Creative Coding Platform

Grid Sandbox is a browser-based creative coding platform that allows users to experiment with various programming languages and visual outputs. The platform focuses on providing a lightweight yet powerful environment for creative coding, supporting languages like JavaScript, Python, and shader programming, with all processing happening on the client side.

## Architecture Vision

The platform will be built as a modern web application with a focus on performance, extensibility, and offline capabilities. All computation happens in the client's browser, enabling users to code and experiment even without an internet connection after the initial load.

## Technical Strategy

### Framework Selection

We'll use **Next.js** as our primary framework for the following reasons:

- **Performance advantages**: Built-in code splitting, optimized bundle sizes
- **SEO benefits**: Server-side rendering capabilities when needed
- **Vercel integration**: Optimized deployment pathway
- **Developer experience**: Improved routing and API structure
- For this project, Next.js provides more benefits without significant cost increases compared to a plain React application.
